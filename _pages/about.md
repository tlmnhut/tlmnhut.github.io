I am a 4<sup>th</sup> year PhD student in computational cognitive science, working with professor [Uri Hasson](http://hasson.org/) at
Center for Mind/Brain Sciences ([CIMeC](https://www.cimec.unitn.it/en)), University of [Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en).

My research is at the intersection of AI and cognitive neuroscience, focusing on two topics:
1. **Alignment of AI models with Human Cognition**: Using pruning techniques and explainable AI, I study how deep neural networks
represent information and how their representations align with human behavior and brain data.
2. **Topographic Models**: I explore models that simulate the spatial and functional organization of the brain,
aiming to create more biologically plausible neural networks for cognitive research.

I am also a member of the [PeARS project](https://pearsproject.org/), a decentralized search engine designed
to run locally on your machine with full control over privacy :)
